# Code along with - Mark Watson's Programming In Scheme: Learn Scheme Through Artificial Intelligence Programs

Back when I was a young lad I found I had a talent for working with technology. While most of my classes during my (unfortunately brief) stay at CMU were focused on CS fundamentals and math I did come across this book in the library (as well as a more theoretical book on neural networks that I can't quite remember the name of) and tried to play around with the code examples. While AI has changed a huge amount since this books was written - and these days I am much more likely to use scheme as a configuration language for Guix than for anything AI related, I am in the process of brushing up on Lisp and am going to give this book a second go!
